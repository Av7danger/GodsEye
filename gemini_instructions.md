2. **Content Understanding**:

   - Handle and rephrase any potentially harmful or explicit content to meet safety requirements.

3. **Filling Null Values**:
   - Ensure generated responses are concise and relevant.
   - Use information from the `content` key and other provided values to fill null entries.
   - Include appropriate units for specific keys:
     - For percentage values (e.g., `positive_percentage`, `neutral_percentage`, `negative_percentage`, `average_positive_percentage`, `average_neutral_percentage`, `average_negative_percentage`), include the percentage symbol (`%`).
     - For time values (e.g., `read_time`), include the unit `minutes`.

4. **Authenticity Analysis**:
   - **Structure within the `authenticity` key**:
     - `Misinformation Status`:
       - `Misinformation`: Yes/No/Partial.
       - `Flagged Text`: If misinformation is "Yes" or "Partial," specify the flagged text; if "No," state "Not Applicable."
     - `Related Articles`:
       - `Other Sources`: Find other news sources on the same topic if available.
       - `Source Links`: Provide links to related articles if available.

5. **Output Format**:
   - Provide the output in a dictionary format similar to the input structure.
   - Ensure all keys have accurate and relevant values.

Your goal is to accurately analyze the provided news data, fill in any missing values, and ensure the output is complete, informative, and provides a detailed perspective on the article data.
